# Haskell Advent of Code 2021

Advent of Code 2021 solutions in Haskell.

## Acknowlegdement

Most of the framework code here was very heavily based on https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-dev.

I started from a blank slate and re-implemented it (mostly in a pretty similar fashion) to help get my head around it.
I've ignored anything I didn't understand (for now), so this has less functionality, but enough for me to be happy using it this year (2021).

## To-do

- Understand lenses better
- Understand TemplateHaskell (and haskell ext) enough to use it to generate the base list of all solutions
- Add functionality to pass test-specific paramaters to solution functions.
